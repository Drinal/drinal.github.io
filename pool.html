		<center><h1>Mercury's Lottery Pool</h1>
<p>As you may or may not know, a lottery pool is basically when a bunch of people pool their points to one person so that the one person buys tickets. If the pool owner wins, all the people who contributed get points back. This way, everyone wins points, but not all of them.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>So how do I enter? Well, you can send me a message on steam or you can tell me directly in-game. However, if you are going to participate in the pool, make CERTAIN that you send me a message saying you are sending me X amount of points. If you don't tell me if you are sending me points or not you may lose them! I will send you a confirmation message to let you know that i'm not afk.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>A few notes to take: <br>
	No Refunds (Whether we lose or if you sent the points and want them back for whatever reason)
	Pool owner goes by Sailor Mercury in-game. (Currently VIP+) Don't trust imposters.
	Points will be given out at about 3:30PM CST. If you don't claim your points in a week, half of them are re-entered into the pool.
	I will only take points in increments of 1k. Any abnormal amount of points will be rounded off and the extra points kept.
